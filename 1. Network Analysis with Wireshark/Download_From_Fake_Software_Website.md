## Overview

This project looks at putting my Network Analysis skills to the test with a PCAP file from the site Malware-Traffic-Analysis. The website gives practice PCAP files to practice network analysis skills on and provide realistic scenarios. I really like using this tool as there is a whole range of scenarios to choose from and test my skills on. The scenario for this analysis is as follows:

_"You work as an analyst at a Security Operation Center (SOC). Someone contacts your team to report a coworker has downloaded a suspicious file after searching for Google Authenticator. The caller provides some information similar to social media posts at:_

https://x.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1882448037030584611_
_Based on the caller's initial information, you confirm there was an infection.  You retrieve a packet capture (pcap) of the associated traffic.  Reviewing the traffic, you find several indicators matching details from a Github page referenced in the above social media posts.  After confirming an infection happened, you begin writing an incident report."_

Here is also a link to the scenario if you want to go and have a look - there is more great training content available on the site so definetly one to have a look at!
