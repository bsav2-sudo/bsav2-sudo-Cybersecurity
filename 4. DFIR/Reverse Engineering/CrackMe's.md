## Overview

In this project, I begin looking at the techniques and tools to be able to start reverse engineering some Crack Me's which are available from (CrackMes.one)[https://crackmes.one/search]. These Crack Me's test my skills on being able to reverse engineer programs from simple to hard relying soley on using reverse engineering tools such as IDA Pro, DBG x64 and more to be able to crack the programs. This will be the start of my journey into the world of reverse engineering and malware analysis seeing as though this area of Cybersecurity is very new to me but a challange I want to face and learn more about. From my persepctive before I can just load a piece of malware into these tools and get started - I want to learn the foundations and build up an understanding of how programs work on a low level.

For me as an individual - malware analysis is a sought after skill - the cybersecurity landscape is ever changing and being able to understand how new attacks and new malware is executed and its behaviours is highly beneficial to a defensive operation and being able to understand what threat actors are looking for. Even just by completing some of these challanges online gives a better understanding of how programs work which when moving onto Malware Analysis can give a more refined perspective on what to look for and possible indicators.

Before I get started I want to clarify that I have already watched some tutorials and done some reading on Assembly, Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering so when I come into this project I can make an efficient start and have a basic understanding. Most of the content I have followed has been from John Hammond, Nathan Braggs and more on YouTube who all deliver very high qulaity content on the subject matters and I would more than highly reccomend looking at.

So without further ado lets get started!
