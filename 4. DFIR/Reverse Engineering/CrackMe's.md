## Overview

In this project, I begin looking at the techniques and tools to be able to start reverse engineering some Crack Me's which are available from [CrackMes.one](https://crackmes.one/search). These Crack Me's test my skills on being able to reverse engineer programs from simple to hard relying soley on using reverse engineering tools such as IDA Pro, DBG x64 and more to be able to crack the programs. This will be the start of my journey into the world of reverse engineering and malware analysis seeing as though this area of Cybersecurity is very new to me but a challange I want to face and learn more about. From my persepctive before I can just load a piece of malware into these tools and get started - I want to learn the foundations and build up an understanding of how programs work on a low level.

For me as an individual - malware analysis is a sought after skill - the cybersecurity landscape is ever changing and being able to understand how new attacks and new malware is executed and its behaviours is highly beneficial to a defensive operation and being able to understand what threat actors are looking for. Even just by completing some of these challanges online gives a better understanding of how programs work which when moving onto Malware Analysis can give a more refined perspective on what to look for and possible indicators.

Before I get started I want to clarify that I have already watched some tutorials and done some reading on Assembly, Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering so when I come into this project I can make an efficient start and have a basic understanding. Most of the content I have followed has been from John Hammond, Nathan Braggs and more on YouTube who all deliver very high qulaity content on the subject matters and I would more than highly reccomend looking at.

So without further ado lets get started!

## Password-cmd Write-Up 

### Program Information

<code> üìò Name: Password-cmd </code>
<code> üë®‚Äçüî¨ Author: UnderKo </code>
<code> üíª Language: C/C++ </code>
<code> Arch x86-64 </code>
<code> Platform: Windows </code>
<code> üìó Difficulty: 1.3 </code>

### Getting Started

First things first, I want to know how this program behaves without looking into it - what does the program do when you launch it and what does it ask for. When launching the program we just get a blank command prompt but after entering random characters we get a message that says "ohh noooo" - okay so not as easy as we think.

<img width="868" alt="1  Program Running" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d59662b-178a-450b-aad0-2200e9391479" />

> Executable being run with a test argument 

<p>So it looks like we need to enter a password which should give us a response that says we've cracked the password - only we don't know what that message is yet and we only know what the incorrect answer message is - however this should be enough to go off when we step into the program. My weapon of choice today is going to be DBG x64 - as a program I love it for being able to see what is being loaded into registers as well as finding strings and following everything in the memory dump - this isn't to say IDA and Ghidra don't do those things - I just like the layour and GUI DBG x64 offers üòÑ so lets get it open and find our entry point in the program.</p>

### DBG x64 Operations

<img width="1439" alt="2  Loaded and Entry Point" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42bb235e-c756-41bb-877e-a557e9a3cda1" />

> Executable loaded into DBG x64 and Entry Point highlighted with red border

Cool - we can now see the program loaded into DBG x64 and as soon as we run the program we get our starting entry point for the program - awesome! When stepping into the program for the first instructions - I expect to see some environments and threads etc. being setup and I'd be right in thinking this as some of the Windows API gets called such as GetCurrentProcessID, QueryPerformanceCounter and more with different arguments being given to these API calls - what I love about this process is I can go to my search engine and search for the API call e.g. GetCurrentProcessID followed by msdn and the first result will always be the API function documentation from Microsoft, luckily Microsoft keeps these up to date and have legacy fucntions too meaning the information is all in one place! 

Anyways I am getting ahead of myself here - setting up everything for the program is great and all but that is not what we are here for - we want to see what argument we have to give the program to give some sort of success message. This is where being able to search for strings is super useful - if I **Right Click** in dbg x64 and go to <code>Search for -> All Modules -> String References</code> I get the References window which will look for strings within the programs - now obviously even though this is a small program there are a lot of strings so we need something that we know gets printed on the command prompt.

Oh I remember - that sarcastic message that says "ohh noo" - let's have a search for that in References...

<img width="1439" alt="2b  String Search" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67432e7e-32e2-46d4-9a2c-2687cbbe0cf3" />

> Search for "ohh noo" in References inside of dbg x64

Hey what do you know that's what we were looking for! And if i double click it to go to the instructions...

<img width="1439" alt="3  Main Function-ohh no comment" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d445025-13c2-4851-855b-42bb1bd3b091" />

> Main function which contains the "ohh noo" string

That's what we want to see. I can see from this that there is two strings one which is our "ohh noo" and another one which is "!crackme!" - If I was a betting man I would be thinking that the string which is "!crackme!" is going to be the one that outputs if we are successful with the password. Looking at the two instructions before the string I think this is a safe bet.

<code> cmp dword ptr ss:[rsp+20], A </code> - The **cmp** first is going to compare to values together 

<code> jne crackme.password.7FF7546E1BC0 </code> - The **jne** is then going to jump if the outcome of that comparison does not equal each other

Okay I think I want to go with this compare function - beacuse if the comparison of the values don't equal each other - then the program jumps to the "ohh noo" string - but if they do equal each other it will bypass the jne instruction and go to the "!crackme!" string instead.

When analysing the compare instruction - there is a hexidecimal value at the end which is 1 out of the 2 compared values - when turning this into decimal we get this...

<img width="1439" alt="4  Compare " src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53dad5e3-7891-49cb-b269-52d850255ccb" />

> Compare instruction with the hexidecimal value into a decimal value in the left pane

Okay now we are getting somewhere - so if both the values are equal to each other we will have the password - and if one of the values is 10, the other value must have to be 10...

Well okay then - let's try it in the program

<img width="869" alt="7  Result" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7702cea-9bd3-4995-b590-9ff92a0c78f9" />

> Value 10 being run in the program - Password is correct

There we go mystery solved! Our password is 10. This was a nice easy one but a really good one to get my feet into reverse engineering - what a nice challange - but it's only getting to get harder from here!

## CrackMe Write-Up 

### Program Information

<code> üìò Name: CrackMe </code>
<code> üë®‚Äçüî¨ Author: Monkeeatingrock </code>
<code> üíª Language: C/C++ </code>
<code> Arch x86-64 </code>
<code> Platform: Windows </code>
<code> üìó Difficulty: 1.1 </code>

### Getting Started

I want to make sure my basic reverse skills are up to scratch, so I'm going to try one more simple crack me but this time I'm going to use Ghidra to reverse this program - just to see what it's like. So lets get started on this one! First things first lets get the program loaded into Ghidra - luckily for us Ghidra has already identified the functions and found the entry point for the program as well.

<img width="1439" alt="1  Ghidra Load" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff5c3146-6c79-47f5-927e-f2ed9f199712" />

> Crack Me loaded into Ghidra with identified Entry Point

Cool - but again as in the last one - I want to know how this program actually behaves - what is it going to ask from the user and what are we given from the program that we can look into on Ghidra. So lets get it run - and as we can see we first get a string that says "Welcome to your first Crack Me program!" - we are then asked what password is - if the password is wrong we get a message saying "Authentication Failed" and then asked to press ENTER to exit the program.

<img width="862" alt="2  Program Run" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ebcfeff-f55c-4b62-a4a6-9dfa2f01e5a6" />

> Program running with a test user input

Okay so now we know what the program looks like - lets see if I can see where we get the message of "Authentication Failed" - firstly one of the most noticable things I want to look at is the symbol references within Ghidra - and straight away when looking at these references we can see most of the Windows API calls that are being made from CrackMe.exe.

<img width="1439" alt="2b  Imported Functions" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35287cb9-8b76-45c5-be9a-512a415f201f" />

> Imported fucntions from CrackMe.exe being seen in Ghidra

While this isn't important at the moment it is good to see where these are stored in Ghirda and that we can see this in both DBG x64 and Ghidra. Okay so lets go digging - we know there might be a string reference to "Authentication Failed" so lets search for it using Ghidra - and what do you know Ghidra points us to the function that uses it...

<img width="1439" alt="3  Identified Main Function" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/381e13e5-8b69-4b87-b1f0-70e55cf16dd1" />

> Function that has a string reference to "Authentication Failed"

When we look closely at this function - we can see Ghidra makes a best guess with psuedo code as to what the program may look like in C - I honestly love this feature in Ghidra - I would rather read some best guess C code rather than go through each instruction in assembly. 

As we can see in this psuedo code - there are three strings which are referenced which are of interest - most notable the highlight at the bottom which is given as the following:

<code> pcVar6 = "Authentication Successful."; </code>

<img width="932" alt="4  Main Focus - Authentication" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ddc7c43-bbb1-4bfa-b39a-bac25ed156d9" />

> Authentication procedure in pseudo code in Ghidra

Okay that is our aim how are we going to get that message to display what we want - which is the "Authentication Successful" - well looking further into the psuedo code we can see that we have an if statment before the message which looks like it is comparing two values together. What is noticable is the following:

<code> ifVar3 = memcmp (ppppuVar5, &local_30, 0xe);
      pcVar6 = "Authentication Successful."; </code>

So it looks like if "Variable 3" is equal to those 3 values then we get the Authentication message. So we could be looking for a string here so lets go looking a bit further up the assembly code just to see if anything is declared as a variable. And hey what do you know this looks promising:

<img width="613" alt="6  String Found" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c22b2454-f9db-488e-9460-e1a042b09a05" />

> String value of "QuiteEasyRight"

Lets check this in the assembly code on the last instructions just to see if we can see this being called...

<img width="638" alt="7  Final Instructions" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97e628e0-8335-4537-a48a-86be6f1adef6" />

> Final assembly instructions before Authentication message

I'm pretty happy that we are going to be calling that string - looks like we have some move instructions and some compares before a call instruction for **VCRUNTIME140.DLL: :memcmp** which is when we get a test of the EAX register to amke sure they are the same - and if they aren't equal to 0 then we jump to the Authentication Unsuccessful message.

So lets run the "QuiteEasyRight" in the program and see what happens...

<img width="865" alt="8  SUCCESS" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13624419-86d5-4d83-b109-f834a3cc8210" />

> Success

And there we are - another program reverse engineered to find the password! This one was quite fun to work on in Ghidra - however I think I might keep using DBG x64 but always good to keep using different programs as they offer different ways of working!

## CrackMe J1 Write-Up 

### Program Information

<code> üìò Name: CrackMe J1 </code>
<code> üë®‚Äçüî¨ Author: juansacco </code>
<code> üíª Language: C/C++ </code>
<code> Arch x86 </code>
<code> Platform: Windows </code>
<code> üìô Difficulty: 2.0 </code>

### Getting Started

Right lets take it up a notch with this reverse engineering - because it isn't going to be as easy as looking at a program's main function and then tracing back - a threat actor is going to use as many tactics as they can to stop someone like us from looking at their code (also known as anti-debugging). One of these anti-debugging tactics is to implement parts of the code to look for a debugger being present - in this crack me were are going to see exactly that.

So first things first lets get the program up and see what it wants us to do...

<img width="872" alt="1  Loaded" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01741d89-6299-4c05-8498-c4b07747cf08" />

> Running the program for the first time

Okay so there's going to be several parts to this crack me, and they are going to ask for serials? Strange I normally go with Weetabix but anyways there's one message we can look for when we put it in the debugger. Speaking of which lets get it loaded into DBG x32 (seeing as though we are now dealing with a 32-bit binary):

<img width="1439" alt="2  Locked and Loadewd" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/735d479c-8125-4a2e-a9b5-8cebff222a7c" />

> CrackMe J1.exe loaded into DBG x32

Cool, as in the other ones the first thing I am going to do is conduct a string search - see if I can find the string from where we first ran the program which asked us for the first serial. And boom we get a hit as well as hits on the other questions that are going to be asked and the instroduction script.

<img width="1439" alt="3  Strings of Searching" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80fdf603-ce9a-49be-9b50-60187fa9528c" />

Just looking at the rest of teh strings - it looks like we have some padding going on with the same string being repeated at different addresses over and over again "What are you looking at? ;-)"

> Padding definition: In reverse engineering, padding refers to extra data inserted into a data structure or file format to align elements to specific boundaries or to obscure the true data structure. This padding is added during compilation or file creation and can complicate the reverse engineering process by introducing seemingly arbitrary bytes that need to be accounted for when analyzing the code or data.

<img width="1439" alt="4  Nice Pad" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42e93290-4fa9-4892-92e5-e6f5905b6279" />

> Nice pad

Good to see this in action but let's not let it distract us from finding the answers - however when going back to the CPU section of DBG x32 - we can see there is a windows command which calls the following:

<code> C:\\Windows\\System32\\shutdown /s /t 5 \n\n </code>

<img width="987" alt="5  Windows Shut Down command" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8901e165-ab78-497f-b7de-0dec51fee018" />

> Windows shutdown commmand being found 

Basically if you give the wrong answer this action will be performed and shut down the PC, clever. I'm going to skip past this for now as I can just look at the code to find the correct answers but again another anti-debugging technique being found within the reverse engineering - we can also see this application in System32 - a very simple but effective way to stop someone from trying to reverse the program.

<img width="605" alt="5b  Windows Shut Down in C" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/599d5811-a159-4448-b0f3-a9127db5ad68" />

> Shutdown application found in C:\Windows\System32

Anyways back to the investigation and ask you can see I've found the string which gave us that message asking for the first serial...

<img width="1136" alt="7  Interesting" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da14e7d6-8b30-4cac-8609-73d25aefb484" />

> String being within the Assembly code

Okay so lets dissect this a bit further - do we have any cmp instruction that is being used before any type of success message - oh look at that we do...

<img width="1048" alt="8  Answer Section - Need to find value" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0415d7e-da44-4e9e-828f-d3ff41470d6b" />

> Cmp instruction followed by success statement and then asking for 2nd Serial

Okay this is good - so now lets look at this compare statement and see what we are looking for - the step to the statement is only met if the numbers are equal - if they are not they go to unsuccessful statement so whatever these values are they need to be the same - to know this number I can either take 14 away from the ebp register at time of running or I can run the compared value to decimal format to see what it would be...

<img width="1439" alt="9  Compare with value 1337" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e030ea7-346d-4962-8463-aa08038934c1" />

> Comparison value is 1337

Okay I'm pretty happy this is what we are looking for as the first answer let's move on to the second one.

### Second Answer

Ok time to get the second answer now - for this I can already see the string which asks us for the second "serial" 

<img width="1024" alt="10  Get Second Value" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffaa71e5-75f9-427a-85dd-1d36150f213e" />

> Second serial question

Looking down the instructions this isn't going to be as simple as a compare instruction as when we look at the success statement there are no comparisons made before it...

<img width="872" alt="11  When we get the correct answer" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d3f3f9d-4fee-4e84-a3be-36b119702732" />

> If serial number 2 is correct

Shame there's going to be something else going on - hold on let me go back to the success message from the 1st answer - something didn't seem right about that message...

<img width="419" alt="12  What computer am i on" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0570e687-81f6-4252-8173-92ecf8ea01e1" />

> What computer am I on????

I mean I know exactly what computer I am on it's mine but what can it be asking - could it be asking for a Computer Name?? Well from Windows I know there is a computer name assigned to the laptop I'm using - but how will the program know about this? There could be one explination for it which we can go looking now - are we doing any Windows API calls which would return a computer name?

Well after digging in strings and matching them with the MS documentation, I found this API call being made...

<img width="1107" alt="13  Get Computer Name Call" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a5a825e-ef25-474d-8c4c-a1c7f653fd16" />

> GetNamedPipeClientComputerNameW being called in instructions

Okay I'm going to be fairly confident the answer is my computer name. I'll make a note of it and lets move to the final answer. 

### Final answer 

This one is actually quite easy - I can already see crackmej1.2014E3 is being moved to the edx register which is then used later and tested for the correct statement. And looking at the string I'm going to say it is this.

<img width="1112" alt="14  Final one - look at that string!" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f32c249-ec95-4f15-ab78-7c2e0cefff06" />

> Final string used for answer 3

Let's use this as the final answer and then get it all put into the program and see how we do:

<img width="1439" alt="15  Success" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f392ab11-5597-4b0f-b7ed-046b0362c491" />

> Success

After testing this it was a success and all "serials" - when the program is complete then it just shuts itself automatically. One thing I have just noticed however when writing this up is there is actually another anti-debugger technique being used in this program - the only reason it didn't get triggered when I entered the answers was because I ran the program natively and not through a debugger.

<img width="1112" alt="16  IsDebuggerPresent" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/321fe9b7-4380-4421-b28f-b95c6ac8a3ee" />

> Windows API - IsDebuggerPresent

As you can see in the green highlight - the Windows API "IsDebuggerPresent" gets called - this API determines whether the calling process is being debugged by a user-mode debugger. This function allows an application to determine whether or not it is being debugged, so that it can modify its behavior. For example, an application could provide additional information using the OutputDebugString function if it is being debugged. (Microsoft, 2025)

A way to get past this would be to put the value in the register as 0 when this function is called - as when a debugger is present the value is set to 1 and then tested with eax registers - if the value is 0 then it tells the program that no debugger is present and it can move on as normal.
