### Professional Statements

I am Ben Savage, a former **Live Events Technician** moving into the world of Cybersecurity - focusing on Network Analysis and Memory Forensics; from conducting my own lab tests to analysing exisiting samples from online sources. From the world of Live Events, I have brought my exisiting networking knowledge and applied it into new areas of the IT World - working with tools such as **WireShark, Scapy, Snort** and **more** to improve my knowledge and test new ideas. I also frequently stay up to date with the latest in Cybersecurity news while also completing CTF's and Labs online. 

Recently, I have been performing **Network Analysis** using **Wirehsark and Scapy** to look at exisiting malicious pcap files that have been submitted online for practice while also researching the ways in which an attack on a network might be commited from a Red Team perspective. I bring professionalism, a unique approach to challanges and 

While also completing my labs and research, I am currently in the process of revising and studying for the <code>Certified Information Systems Security Professional Certification</code> and also the <code>GIAC Intrusion Analyst Certification.</code>

### Labs 

Listed below are some of the highlighted projects/labs I have completed as part of my Cybersecurity Portfolio - ranging from Network Analysis to real-world investigations into emerging technqiues that are being used in the world of Cybersecurity.

#### 1. Network Analysis with Wireshark

<code>Wireshark</code> <code>IPv4 and IPv6</code> <code>TCP and UDP</code> <code>Network Forensics</code> <code>Traffic Analysis</code>

In this project, I use **Wireshark** to analyse existing PCAP files to look at normal and malicous traffic behaviour to differentiate and find IOC's through these PCAP's. These include looking at the <code>TCP and UDP Protocols </code> , <code> HTTP Requests and Posts </code> , <code> IPv4 and ARP Traffic </code> and more. This project looks at a range of PCAP files such as DOS attacks, Malware Analysis, Scanning via nmap and more. The projects focus is to be able to differentiate normal traffic with malicious traffic in Large PCAP files as large organisations will have a large amount of network traffic - so the ability to effectively pick out malicious traffic details is imperative to a successful IT Security Operation.

#### 3. IDS and IPS with Snort

<code>IDS and IPS</code> <code>Snort</code> <code>Rule Making</code> <code>Traffic Analysis</code> <code>IP Headers</code> 

In this networking security project. I use **Snort** to create IDS and IPS rules - testing these rules actively to see how they work within Snorts reporting as well as making adjustments where necessaru to complete these rules. This project also implements the use of **Scapy** to create manipulated packets to be able to test these IDS/IPS rules. Furthermore - this project looks at some of the Community rules created, analysing these rules and the use case of these in a real-world scenario.

#### 8. Investigation into Emerging Techniques in Cybersecurity

<code>Research Project</code> <code>Cybersecurity News</code> <code>Emerging Threats</code> <code>Patching and Vulnerability Assesment</code>

This documentation is a research blog into the latest emerging techniques that hackers and the like are using to bypass IT Security - using resources such as LinkedIn's Cyber News, NCSC News as well as other reputable sources. The aim of this blog is to highlight the emerging and fast paced environment of Cybersecurity, being able to identify new vulnerabilities and identifying new risks as soon as possible.
